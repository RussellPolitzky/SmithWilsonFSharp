Native Providers for Math.NET Numerics
======================================

To use the native library:

1. In VisualStudio, set "Copy to Output Directory" for both MathNet.Numerics.MKL.dll and libiomp5md.dll to "Copy always",
   or place the native libraries manually into the same directory as your application's executable.*

2. In your application code, set the value of `Control.LinearAlgebraProvider` to the native provider you are using.
   For example: `Control.LinearAlgebraProvider = new MathNet.Numerics.Algorithms.LinearAlgebra.Mkl.MklLinearAlgebraProvider();`

* The native library can also be placed in your current PATH or in the system PATH. However, it is much easier to just to place it in the same directory as the executable.
